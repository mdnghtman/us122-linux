Tascam US-122 Driver Setup for Linux Systems


A little bash-script to automate the installation of the Tascam US-122 based on [this post from debianforum.de](https://debianforum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=154286&sid=06c30f7db54f10ee354648a81cfa4721&start=30#p1036200)
This script will download all needed files, extract the Bus and Device Number of your device and configure the driver.
Reboot after the script has finished and you should be good to go.
